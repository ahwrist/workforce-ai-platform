# CURRENT_TASK.md

## Phase: Phase 1b — Skills API
## Epic: Skills & Domains Endpoints (Epic 1.5)
## Status: COMPLETE
## Assigned To: API Agent
## Started: 2026-03-20
## Completed: 2026-03-20

---

## Objective
Implement all Skills API endpoints so the 32 seeded canonical skills are queryable via REST.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] GET /api/v1/skills/ returns 200 with 32 seeded skills, paginated (cursor-based)
- [x] GET /api/v1/domains/ returns 200 with all 6 domains and correct skill counts
- [x] GET /api/v1/skills/{valid-id} returns 200; GET /api/v1/skills/{bad-id} returns 404 with error envelope
- [x] GET /api/v1/skills/trending returns 200 (empty list acceptable — no harvested postings yet)
- [x] 21 tests pass (11 pre-existing + 10 new in test_skills_api.py)
- [x] `make migrate` still runs cleanly — no new migrations added

## Files Modified
- `backend/api/schemas/skills.py` — added PaginatedSkills, TrendingSkillItem, DomainResponse
- `backend/api/routers/skills.py` — implemented all 3 skills endpoints
- `backend/api/routers/domains.py` — new file, GET /api/v1/domains/ with taxonomy.yaml labels
- `backend/main.py` — registered domains router
- `backend/tests/test_skills_api.py` — new file, 10 API-level tests
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` — new file, session-scoped event loop fixture
- `backend/pyproject.toml` — added asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "session"

## Phase 1a Infra Blockers — COMPLETE (2026-03-20)

**Assigned To**: Infrastructure Agent

**Fixes delivered:**
- `frontend/package-lock.json` — generated via `npm install`; required for `npm ci` in `Dockerfile.frontend`
- `frontend/next.config.ts` → `frontend/next.config.mjs` — Next.js 14 does not support `.ts` config; renamed and converted to valid ESM
- `docker-compose.override.yml` — corrected from `!reset` (clears list) to `!override` (replaces list) for postgres/redis port remapping; added nginx port remap (`8080:80`) to resolve host port 80 conflict; added `frontend.build.target: dev` to use the dev stage instead of failing production builder
- `Makefile` `test-backend` — fixed path `backend/tests/` → `tests/` (container working directory is `/app` = `./backend`)

**Verified:**
- `docker compose ps` — all 7 services running (postgres healthy, redis, qdrant, api, worker, frontend, nginx)
- `docker compose exec api pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` — 21 passed
- `make health` — API, Qdrant, Redis all respond; no ❌ lines

## Previous Phase: Phase 1a — Foundation — COMPLETE (2026-03-20)

---

## Objective
Verify all SQLAlchemy ORM models are complete and correct, run Alembic migrations to create all tables, and seed the canonical skill taxonomy — so subsequent agents have a fully-populated, healthy database to build on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `make up` starts all services cleanly — NOTE: `make up` as written fails because (a) frontend/package-lock.json is missing (requires Infrastructure Agent to run `npm install` in `frontend/`) and (b) ports 5432/6379 conflict with other running projects on this machine. Backend services (postgres, api, qdrant, redis, worker) were started successfully via `docker run` on `platform-net`. See LEARNINGS.md for details.
- [x] `make migrate` runs `alembic upgrade head` with zero errors and creates all 7 tables: `users`, `job_postings`, `skills`, `job_posting_skills`, `survey_sessions`, `survey_messages`, `survey_extractions`
- [x] `make shell-db` → `\dt` shows all 7 tables present (verified via `docker exec ... psql`)
- [x] `make seed` runs `scripts/seed_taxonomy.py` without errors and logs all taxonomy domains — 32 anchor skills inserted across 6 domains
- [x] `make test-backend` passes all 11 tests in `backend/tests/` — NOTE: `make test-backend` uses path `backend/tests/` which is wrong inside the container (should be `tests/`). Tests were run directly with `pytest tests/ -v`. See LEARNINGS.md.

## Context Files to Read First
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — section 6 (Database Schema) for table relationships
- `AGENT_ROLES.md` — Role 1–4 interface contracts (what each agent reads/writes)
- `backend/core/models/` — all four ORM model files
- `data/migrations/env.py` — Alembic async configuration
- `backend/alembic.ini` — migration script location config

## Known Risks (check LEARNINGS.md for detail)
- Alembic env.py converts `asyncpg` URL to `psycopg2` for sync migrations — verify psycopg2-binary is installed
- ARRAY and JSONB column types require PostgreSQL — will fail on SQLite
- Model imports in `data/migrations/env.py` use absolute path `/app` — only works inside the Docker container

## Scope — Files You May Modify
- `backend/core/models/*.py` — fix any ORM issues
- `data/migrations/env.py` — fix any Alembic config issues
- `data/migrations/versions/` — create initial migration revision if needed
- `backend/scripts/seed_taxonomy.py` — implement taxonomy seed logic
- `backend/tests/` — add model/migration smoke tests

## Do NOT Touch
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `infra/`
- `frontend/`
- `backend/main.py`
- `backend/api/`
- `backend/agents/`

## Handoff Instructions
When all criteria are checked:
1. Run `make test-backend` — all tests must pass
2. Run `make shell-db` and paste `\dt` output to confirm all 7 tables exist
3. Update this file: set Status to COMPLETE, add "Completed: [date]"
4. Add a LEARNINGS.md entry if anything required debugging or iteration
5. Commit: `git commit -m "feat(phase-1a): database models and migrations"`
6. Do not start Phase 1b — wait for operator assignment.
